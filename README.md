### PHP & Symfony Learning Journey

This repository is dedicated to my learning path in backend development using PHP and Symfony framework. Here, I'll document my progress, code share and developed projects through an 8-week study plan, aiming upgrade my skills and be prepared for a job opportunity as PHP/Symfony Developer.

**Goals:**
- **Dominate the fundamentals of PHP**: Focus on basic syntax, control structures, OOP and other essential features of PHP.
- **Explore the Symfony Framework**: Learn to set up and use Symfony to build robust and maintanable web apps.
- **Set up and use web servers**: Pratice the settings and use of servers app like Nginx and Apache, essentials to PHP apps hosting.
- **Work with data bases**: Use MySQL or PostgreSQL to manage data, integrating with PHP throuth the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) provided by Symfony.
- **Develop and consume APIs RESTful**: Create APIs that follow the REST principles to interact with other applications or frontend services.
- **Utilize Docker**: Learn to containerize applications using Docker, enhancing develpment, testing, and deployment processes. 

**Used Tecnologies:**
- **Programming Language**: PHP
- **Web Framework**: Symfony
- **Web Servers**: Nginx, Apache
- **Data Bases**: MySQL, PostgreSQL
- **Other Tools**: Git, GitHub, Docker (for containerization)

**Repo Structure:**
- `/src`: Source code for projects and exemples.
- `/docs`: Additional documentation, study notes and resources.
- `/tests`: Unit and integration tests.
- `/docker`: Dockerfiles and related configuration files.

**How to use:**
> P.s.: I'll provide basic instrutions on how to set up and run the project as I progress.
- **Docker Setup**:
  - Ensure Docker is installed on your system.
  - Navigate to the root directory of this project.
  - Run `docker-compose up -d` to start the services defined in your `docker-compose.yml`. This file should be set up to start your PHP environment, web server, and database system.
  - Access the application through the specified ports (that should be 8080).
